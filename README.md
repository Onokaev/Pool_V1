# Pool_V1
Pool_V1 is a payment system for a pool table. Insted of placing coins on the tray for balls to be released, payment is done through M-PESA and as soon as a confirmation message is received, the pool balls are released. 
This does not eliminate the traditional placing of coins to release the balls. The two will work hand in hand.
